abstract = {TRADITIONALLY,the people responsible for posi- tioning brands have concentrated on points of difference -the benefits that set each brand apart from the competition. Maytag is distinguished by de- pendability, Tide by whitening power, BMW by superior handling. Such points of differentiation are, In many cases, what consumers remember about a brand. But points of differentiation alone are not enough to sustain a brand against competitors. Managers often pay too little atten- tion to two other aspects of competitive positioning: un- derstanding the frame of reference within which their brands work and addressing the features that brands have in common with competitors. There are always circum- stances in which it's necessary to "break even" with com- peting brands. Effective brand positioning requires not only rants: healthfulness. But Subway's executives were con- cerned about the brand's competitive frame of reference and the attendant pointsof parity. While they were eager to reposition the brand-sales had been flat for two years- they saw taste as the sine qua non of the fast-food frame of reference and believed that taste is more important than healthfulness to core fast-ftxid customers. Subway's research suggested that the company, which has more stores than any other fast-food operation, could success- fully compete on taste with the burger giants, whose sales dwarf Subway's. And executives knew that fast-food con- sumers often perceive good taste and healthfulness to be at odds. Management feared that a strong health-centered campaign would jeopardize the perception of Subway as a fast-food establishment. Conventional},

abstract = {The intensity of competition in an industry determines the degree to which investment inflows drive returns to the free market level, hence the ability of firms in the industry to sustain above average returns. Intensity of competition is not a matter of luck. The underly-ing economic and technological characteristics of the industry determine the strength of the five basic competitive forces-threat of new entrants, bargaining power of buyers, rivalry between existing competitors, threat of substitute products and bargaining power of suppliers. These forces range from intense in industries like tires, paper and steel, where no firm earns spectacular returns, to mild in industries such as oil field equipment and services, cosmetics and toiletries, where high returns are common. The goal of competitive strategy for a company is to find a position in its industry where these competitive forces will do it the most good or the least harm. A company may take a defensive posture, positioning itself so that its capabilities provide the best defense against the existing array of competitive forces. Alternatively, it can take an offensive approach by developing strategies designed to influence the balance of existing forces or to exploit a change in the competitive balance before rivals recognize it. The first step in structural analysis is an assessment of the competitive environment in which the company operates-the basic competitive forces and the strength of each in shaping industry structure. The second is an assessment of the company's own strategy-of how well it has positioned itself to prosper in this environment. Taken together, these steps are the key to forecasting a company's earning power.},

abstract = {The decade of the nineties witnessed a significant increase in business-level strategy research relating to the competitive actions and reactions carried out among competing firms. Rooted in the Schumpter' theory of creative destruction, this work has examined causes and consequences of firm-level action and reaction, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing, and market signaling. In this chapter, we critically review the competitive dynamics literature in terms of underlying theory, methods and results. Our review reveals that the strongest and most consistent empirical relationships include: the negative relationship between action/reaction timing and firm performance and the positive relationship between action/reaction aggressiveness and performance. This research also reveals that competitive reaction can be predicted based on characteristics of the action. These relationships hold up in a great variety of samples, as competitive dynamics research has been conducted on a great variety of firms and industries. However, we note a bias toward large, single business, public, domestic firms. The methods are also biased towards archival research, leaving opportunities to study management intentions. The chapter concludes with a discussion of alternative theoretical perspectives, which offer opportunities for expanding the domain of competitive dynamics research.},

abstract = {Software as a Service (SaaS) is regarded as a favorable solution to enhance a modern organization's IT performance and competitiveness; however, many organizations may still be reluctant to introduce SaaS solutions mainly because of the trust concern - they may perceive more risks than benefits. This paper presumes that an organization will augment the trust of adopting SaaS solutions when perceived risks decrease and/or perceived benefits increase. To gain insights into this issue, a solution framework using a modified Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach is proposed. The core logic is to treat perceived benefits and perceived risks as two distinct themes so that a visible cause-effect diagram can be developed to facilitate the decision makers. A case study is conducted on a Taiwanese company - one of the world's leading manufacturers in the niche and specialized resistor markets. The findings suggest that the case company concern more about strategic-oriented benefits than economic-oriented benefits and more about subjective risks than technical risks. Some implications are addressed accordingly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its modified versions have been popularly utilized for examining how users come to accept a new technology, but have not yet been employed to handle issues regarding SaaS adoption. This paper attempts to develop an explorative model that examines important factors affecting SaaS adoption, in order to facilitate understanding with regard to adoption of SaaS solutions. An explorative model using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling is proposed and a number of hypotheses are tested, which integrate TAM related theories with additional imperative constructs such as marketing effort, security and trust. Thus, the findings of this study can not only help enterprise users gain insights into SaaS adoption, but also help SaaS providers obtain inspiration in their efforts to discover more effective courses of action for improving both new product development and marketing strategy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite that Software as a Service (SaaS) seems to be the most tempting solution among different types of cloud services, yet it has not been adopted to-date with as much alacrity as was originally expected. A variety of factors may influence the adoption of SaaS solutions. The objective of this study is thus to explore the significant factors affecting the adoption of SaaS for vendors and enterprise users. An analytical framework is proposed containing two approaches - Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Rough Set Theory (RST). An empirical study on the IT/MIS enterprises in Taiwan is carried out. The results have revealed a considerable amount of meaningful information, which not only facilitates the SaaS vendors to grasp users' needs and concerns about SaaS adoption, but also helps the managers to introduce effective marketing strategies and actions to promote the growth of SaaS market. Based on the findings, some managerial implications are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, its diffusion is not evenly distributed: some organizational users are open to SaaS but others are still hesitant despite the huge cost saving it may bring. The behavioral impacts of SaaS are far-reaching and the new socio-technical phenomenon deserves a close look. Based on the literature review, this study proposes a tripod model of SaaS Readiness that suggests that organizational users need to get prepared from technological, organizational and environmental aspects for the adoption of SaaS. The empirical results support that all three aspects are important for SaaS adoption yet their influences vary across psychological and overt outcome variables.},

abstract = {We analyze the equilibrium size of networks under alternative market structures. Networks are characterized by positive size externalities (commonly called "network externalities"). That is, the benefits of the addition of an extra node (or an extra customer) exceed the private benefits accruing to the particular node (or customer). A direct consequence of this demand structure is that perfect competition does not implement the optimal outcome. Because of the externality, there exists a range of prices within which three different network sizes can be supported as equilibria: a zero size network, an intermediate size that is unstable, and a large stable and Pareto optimal one. We expect that the market will select the largest of the three equilibrium networks. As a result, small networks will not be observed. We call critical mass the size of the smallest network that can be supported in equilibrium. Alternative allocation systems internalize the network externality to different degrees, and therefore result in a variety of sizes of critical masses and price-network size paths. A welfare-maximizing planner supports a larger network than results in perfect competition. Surprisingly, a monopolist, even if allowed to influence consumers' expectations, always chooses a network of smaller size than in perfect competition. Oligopolists of compatible network goods support networks of smaller size than perfect competition and larger than monopoly. We extend our results to durable goods in a dynamic setting. In the presence of a downward time trend for industry marginal cost, the presence of network externalities increases the speed at which market demand grows. We use this prediction to calibrate the model and obtain estimates of the parameter measuring a consumer's valuation of the installed base (i.e., the network effect) using aggregate time series data on prices and quantities in the US fax market.},

However, while some market research and IT provider firms fervently support this point of view, others already conjure up the failure of this on-demand sourcing option. Oftentimes based on weak empirical data and shaky reasoning, these inconsistent perspectives lack scientific rigor and neglect to present a more differentiated picture of SaaS-adoption. This study seeks to deepen the understanding of factors driving the adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Grounded in transaction cost theory, the resource-based view, and the theory of planned behavior, we develop a research model to assess SaaS-adoption at the application level. Survey data of 297 firms in Germany with 374 valid response items across different industries were collected to test the theoretical model. Our analysis revealed that patterns on the decision on SaaS-adoption differ across application types. Social influence, attitude toward SaaS-adoption, adoption uncertainty, and strategic value turned out to be the strongest and most consistent drivers across all application types. Furthermore, we found that firm size does not matter in SaaS-adoption, since large enterprises and small- and medium-sized companies had similar adoption rates. Overall, this study provides relevant findings that IT vendors can use to better appeal to potential companies that consider adopting SaaS.},

This study also attempts to find the influence of competitive tension on strategic innovation decisions and implementation. A quantitative research design was employed.
